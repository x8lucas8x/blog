      <description>&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For quite some time, my blog has not received the attention that I would like to give it. However,
as my undergraduation approaches its end, I decided to rebuild it as a static website, instead of
continue using blogger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The motivation was twofold. First, provide me more control over my own blog. Second,
learn more about web technologies (i.e. HTML, CSS, JS) in the way. So, that&amp;rsquo;s it.
Hope you can find some interesting posts here in the near future o/.&lt;/p&gt;
