A mentee of mine has been recently pushing for a change of pace. The last two projects led by him were a departure from what he was used to working on – both in subject and difficulty. Despite any shortcomings, he was happy with how much he had learned in a short period. Yet, he got the feedback from his manager which roughly looked like: You can be more proactive…

I guess probably every engineer has got that at some point in their careers. And there are certainly many ways to make the feedback actionable, by mentioning a recent particular situation to which the feedback applies and how it could have been different.

That said, I would rather not delve deep into the particulars of my mentee's situation today, but rather focus on a broader perspective. That is, my understanding of proactivity. A once very inexperienced myself, for instance, thought that was about being a “Yes, sir” kind of person. How wrong was I. I see this still in newer coworkers, who feel like a new problem deserves the same attention as the ones that came before. When you add to this that a higher authority or more experienced person identified it, it seems to outbalance the judgement of urgency even more.  Because one feels you are supposed to tackle things before anybody asks you to, especially if the new issue is dear to someone you admire.

Well, I can definitely think of proactivity in terms of me doing things that nobody had to ask in the first place. That's absolutely valuable and can qualify as being proactive, but I also know that if everything is time-sensitive, nothing is. That's it, qualities such as prioritization and proactivity can also get in the way of each other. In a way, getting things done before you're asked is a very atomized perception of what it means to be proactivity.

Proactivity as a value cannot be judged by little disparate tasks being done here and there. Otherwise, we would be all proactive by definition. Proactivity, just like values such as prioritization, are assessed in a wider arena – through the forest, not the tree.

Let me tell a story here. In my last role, I've bootstrapped a new way of scaling the company's programmatic marketing (e.g., Adwords, Facebook Ads) operation. My skip-level manager from HQ was around with my manager and called me. They were excited by the potential and asked a subjective question about the infant project, which I don't quite remember, but could be any of:

How do you think we could solve for this issue next?
What should be the next step for this?
Person X has mentioned Y about it, what can we do about it?
The precise question doesn't really matter in this situation, what matters is how I reacted – as a 27–28-year-old Lucas that should have known better. I reacted by saying something on the lines of an honest: I don't know. And then went to sit down and go about my day trying to fix a bug I was facing – as if it were just as important.

Now, what came next was that they asked the other engineer who joined me later in this project, and I was not around, but he might have had the sensibility to know how he should have acted. To spare you of the suspense, proactively when it matters. And I say that because I noticed he was increasingly taking the lead on the project. At the same time, management started relying more on him to answer such subjective questions on the direction of the project. Not long after, this person received a promotion to senior before me. Naturally, my colleague might have earned his promotion due to a multitude of reasons, but I also think it wouldn't have hurt to have scored that win for me.

In hindsight, there is nothing wrong about stating you don't know something, but how better it would have been if I weren't as indifferent. If I had just said: You know what, I don't know right now, but let me get back to you in X hours. Or, even better, if I had been already spending some time on the vision I was driving to say any of:

It's funny that you ask because I've been thinking about this lately, and I think we could either … or …
Or, to top it all, if I had been in touch with my early users, to know their pains before anybody else – one experienced of which sited as far as the next chair. So that I could say:

So, I've been having chats with person X about it, and it's clear to me that we should focus on … for now.
Anyway, that situation in which I felt short of the required sensibility, is one that remains in my memory to this date, even though I have a terrible one. This says a lot about how I recognized it as one of the pivotal moments in my early career – when I truly understood what being proactive is about and when it matters.
