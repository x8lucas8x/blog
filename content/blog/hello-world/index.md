For quite some time, my blog has not received the attention that I would like to give it. However,
as my undergraduation approaches its end, I decided to rebuild it as a static website, instead of
continue using blogger.

The motivation was twofold. First, provide me more control over my own blog. Second,
learn more about web technologies (i.e. HTML, CSS, JS) in the way. So, that's it.
Hope you can find some interesting posts here in the near future o/.
