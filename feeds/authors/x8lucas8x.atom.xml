However,
as my undergraduation approaches its end, I decided to rebuild it as a static website, instead of
using blogger. The motivation was twofold. First, provide me more control over my own blog. Second,
learn more about web technologies in the way. So, that&amp;#8217;s it. Hope you can find some interesting
posts here in the near future&amp;nbsp;o/.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="pelican"></category><category term="publishing"></category><category term="personal"></category><category term="blog"></category></entry></feed>
